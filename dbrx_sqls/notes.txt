Thank you for providing the JSON sample. Here’s how you can flatten this JSON and create a table in Databricks using SQL:

1. Upload the JSON file to DBFS
First, upload your Commodities-20250913.json file to DBFS (Databricks File System), e.g., to /FileStore/tables/Commodities-20250913.json.

2. Create a Table from the JSON File
3. Flatten the JSON Structure
Here’s a sample SQL query to flatten your JSON structure. This assumes each row is a JSON object as in your sample:

Notes:
This query uses LATERAL VIEW explode() to flatten the arrays (CFI and its Attributes).
Adjust the file path if your file is in a different location.
If your JSON file contains an array of objects at the root, you may need to use from_json or inline functions.
Let me know if you need a Databricks notebook version or further customization!
